🧠 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science – My Journey

Welcome to my repository for CS50, Harvard University's renowned Introduction to Computer Science course. This repository chronicles my hands-on experience, problem sets, and projects completed throughout the course.

📚 Course Overview

CS50 is an entry-level course that delves into the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Designed for majors and non-majors alike, it covers a broad spectrum of topics:

Programming Languages: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Core Concepts: Algorithms, Data Structures, Memory Management, Security, Software Engineering, Web Development
Problem Domains: Biology, Cryptography, Finance, Forensics, Gaming
The course emphasizes algorithmic thinking and problem-solving efficiency, culminating in a final project that synthesizes the learned concepts.
